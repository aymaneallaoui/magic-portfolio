# Introduction

Countless framework designers and programmers have found that MVC (Model-View-Controller) is the most successful way of organizing code in web development. It has been used in various frameworks and projects guiding the arrangement of applications by developers. However, let’s be honest, MVC is not perfect. This means that it contains multiple weaknesses that make coding complex; maintainability can turn into a nightmare and may lead to disappointments among the developers. When we are building a web application, it will be important for us to learn from such weaknesses without completely dismissing MVC. In this blog post, we shall discuss some of these shortcomings associated with MVC.

## The Problem with MVC

According to its proponents, Model should manage data while View should render UI and Controller should act as an intermediary between both of them. At first sight, this separation seems reasonable enough but at practice it results in bulky controllers, thin models and tight coupling components.

### Let's take a look at a typical MVC setup in PHP

<CodeBlock
  codes={[
    {
      language: "php",
      label: "Classic MVC Example",
      code: `class PostController {
    public function index() {
        $posts = Post::getAll();
        require('views/posts/index.php');
    }
}

class Post {
public static function getAll() {
// Fetch posts from the database
}
}

// View
foreach ($posts as $post) {
    echo "<h2>{$post->title}</h2>";
echo "<p>{$post->content}</p>";
}`,
},
]}
/>

<Text>
  It is the controller’s responsibility in this example to retrieve information
  from the model and pass it on to the view for rendering. Nonetheless, with the
  growth of an application, a controller tends to become overloaded with logic
  for handling various requests thereby adding onto its difficulty of
  maintainability and testing.
</Text>

## The Proposal: Going beyond MVC

Instead of blindly following MVC, we could adopt a more elastic architecture that addresses the inadequacies of MVC. One of them involves blending Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).

<Text>
  <strong>DDD</strong> puts greater emphasis on what are referred to as
  domain-driven models rather than the technical frameworks used when building
  applications. By defining richly structured domains that include distinct
  entities, value objects, and aggregates, we can confine most business rules
  within applications.
</Text>

<Text>
  <strong>CQRS</strong> helps split our application into read or write
  operations thus optimizing read and write models independently such that they
  improve performance and scalability.
</Text>

### Let's refactor our previous example using DDD and CQRS principles

<CodeBlock
  codes={[
    {
      language: "php",
      label: "Refactored with DDD & CQRS",
      code: `// Controller
class PostController {
    private $postService;

    public function __construct(PostService $postService) {
        $this->postService = $postService;
    }

    public function index() {
        $posts = $this->postService->getAllPosts();
        require('views/posts/index.php');
    }

}

// Service
class PostService {
private $postRepository;

    public function __construct(PostRepository $postRepository) {
        $this->postRepository = $postRepository;
    }

    public function getAllPosts() {
        return $this->postRepository->getAll();
    }

}

// Repository
class PostRepository {
public function getAll() {
// Fetch posts from the database
}
}

// View
foreach ($posts as $post) {
    echo "<h2>{$post->getTitle()}</h2>";
echo "<p>{$post->getContent()}</p>";
}`,
},
]}
/>

<Text>
  So in this example, we have introduced a service layer responsible for
  orchestrating business logic and a repository layer responsible for
  interacting with the data store. This separation of concerns makes our code
  base more <strong>maintainable</strong> and <strong>testable</strong>.
</Text>

## Conclusion

<Text>
  So, the end point of this discussion will be that while MVC has been used as a
  model for web based applications for years, it is important to realise its
  inadequacies. By taking lessons from MVC’s flaws as well as embracing other
  flexible architectures like DDD and CQRS we can come up with web applications
  that are easier to maintain, scale up and follow clean code and good design
  principles. Thus let us go beyond MVC and embrace the changing structure of
  web applications.
